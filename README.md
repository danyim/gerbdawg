# Gerbdawg

[https://gerbdawg.herokuapp.com/](https://gerbdawg.herokuapp.com/)

Made with generator-gulp-angular, Firebase, SCSS, Bootstrap, and Heroku


## Deployment
- `gulp clean && gulp build`
- **NOTE:** `/dist` is commented out in the .gitignore because web.js needs to read from that folder in order for Heroku to work
